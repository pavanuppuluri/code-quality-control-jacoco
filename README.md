# Integrating JaCoCo with Spring Boot for Code Coverage

### What is JaCoCo?

**JaCoCo** (Java Code Coverage) is a code coverage library for Java that helps in measuring how much of your source code is covered by tests. It provides tools to track coverage metrics such as:

- **Line coverage**: How many lines of code were executed during testing.
- **Branch coverage**: Whether the decision points (if-else) in your code have been tested.
- **Instruction coverage**: Which bytecode instructions have been executed.

JaCoCo can integrate with various build tools (Maven, Gradle) and CI/CD tools (like Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to generate code coverage reports, which are valuable for ensuring that your application is thoroughly tested.

### Steps to Integrate JaCoCo in a Spring Boot Application

#### Step 1: Create a Spring Boot Project

You can create a Spring Boot project from scratch or use Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) to generate the project.

- Choose the desired settings (e.g., dependencies like `Spring Web`, `Spring Boot DevTools`, `Spring Boot Test`).
- Download the generated `.zip` file and extract it.

---

#### Step 2: Add JaCoCo Plugin to Maven

JaCoCo integrates easily with Maven. You need to add the JaCoCo Maven plugin to your `pom.xml` file.

##### Add the JaCoCo Plugin in `pom.xml`

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <!-- JaCoCo plugin for code coverage -->
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
            <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>0.8.7</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>prepare-agent</goal>  <!-- Prepare JaCoCo Agent -->
                        <goal>report</goal>        <!-- Generate Coverage Report -->
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

#### Step 3: View the Coverage Report
After running the tests, you can view the code coverage report. Open the index.html file located in the target/site/jacoco/ directory in a browser.

The report will show the following information:

- Overall Coverage: How much of the code is covered by tests.
- Per-Class Coverage: The line coverage and branch coverage for each class.
- Missed Lines: Which lines of code were not covered by tests.
